# Autochess RPG

## What is this game?
This project is an attempt to blend the gameplay of the emerging popular game genre known as 'Autochess' games with some RPG aspects. 
In an autochess game units are traditionaly placed on a tile based map and engage in combat on a round based system.

## RPG???
Unlike in a regular autochess game which ends after the game is over, this game is aiming to have a more persistent world for the player to progress through, and level up their units/team in.
